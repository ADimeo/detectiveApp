# App for the Gameprog Detective Game

The App uses this Server: [https://github.com/EatingBacon/gameprog-detective-server/](https://github.com/EatingBacon/gameprog-detective-server/)

An introduction to the Project and the Game are [here](https://github.com/EatingBacon/gameprog-detective-server/blob/master/README.md) (in German).

### App Setup
To get the App running, take the latest Release (Server and App Version should match).  
Install the Apk ([How to install an Apk](https://www.androidpit.com/android-for-beginners-what-is-an-apk-file#howto)).  
You also need to have installed and setup Telegram for this App to work.
If you don't have a running server, start the App with `--ez MOCKAPI true`

### How to use
*(If you don't want the App to upload your Contacts, Calendar Events and more over a insecure connection to our Server, check the "Safety Mode" Switch on)*

After first opening the App, click *Contact Andy Abbot*. 
This will open a Telegram Chat, where you can talk with him. 
When he gives you Tasks, the App will show a Notification and you can complete the Tasks in the App

### Settings
**Server URL**: Change the Server URL (works dynamically, butr you may have to reset, since the new Server doesn't store your User)   
**Safety Mode**: If on, the App will not upload any of your data. This also means Tasks cannot be finished   
**Reset**: Resets all your Data the App and the Server stored from you
